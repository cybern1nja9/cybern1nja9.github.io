From my childhood I’ve always been curious about how things work and how they can be manipulated. Over time, this curiosity has driven me to dive deep into hacking and securing not only applications and networks but also physical systems and critical infrastructure. In this blog, I share my experiences and thoughts on the cybersecurity, from vulnerabilities and hacking techniques to practical tips on defense. I hope you find something useful here, and I’d love to connect and chat about all things cybersecurity. 👨‍💻 What I Do Vulnerability Management (Tenable One), Web, API, Thick Client, Mobile App PenTesting\nCertifications and resume Course/Certificate Organization Badge Obtained Certificate APIsec Certified Practitioner(ACP) APIsec University May 2025 Accredible You can find these details on my Linkedin Profile as well.\nYou can find my resume here: [Resume] /docs/Abhishek Rajput.pdf\n📌 Current Focus Leveling up in Web app, API and Mobile App Hacking Bug Bounty Hunting Weight training: Chasing that 75kg goal 🏋️ Gotta REACH THE PEAK! ❤️‍🔥Area of Interests Application Security (AppSec)\nInfra Pentesting and Red Teaming\nOther forms of Offensive Security\n🧠 Personal Philosophy Research like a scholar, think like a hacker, and learn like a kid. | Research\tTrain\tHack\tRepeat!\n“Improve at least 1% every day.”\n","permalink":"//localhost:58644/whoami/","summary":"Security Consultant, AppSec/OffSec enthusiast.","title":"$ whoami"}]
