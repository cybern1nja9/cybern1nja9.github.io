Yes, it is - It\u0026rsquo;s a BFLA finding, since we as an attacker has the role: Customer (low privileged account) and we were able to perform unauthorized + high-level privileged function.\nLevel 2 — BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization) We\u0026rsquo;ll perform \u0026ldquo;A-B\u0026rdquo; testing\u0026hellip;so create two accounts.\nOne will act as an attacker\u0026rsquo;s account and the other one will be the victim\u0026rsquo;s account.\nAttacker - UserA Victim - UserB The PUT /profile allows user to edit their profile information\nProfile info updated for userA- *Attack —\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s change the profile info of userB.\nThis can be achieved by changing the username value to userB (victims account) but using the auth token of userA (attacker)\nOriginal request\nTampered request\nProfile info updated for userB by userA!!\nTo summarize this BOLA vulnerability -\nWe are authenticated as userA.\nThe API endpoint /profile is properly secured, meaning only authenticated users can access it. This prevents a “Broken Authentication” vulnerability, since unauthenticated users cannot access the function.\nHowever, the authorization check is flawed. Instead of verifying that the username in the request body matches the username associated with the authorization token, the API simply trusts the value provided in the request body.\nBy changing the username from userA to userB, we were successfully able to modify an object (userB\u0026rsquo;s profile) that we are not authorized to interact with.\nWe can also send the PUT /profile request to Intruder targeting \u0026ldquo;username\u0026rdquo; parameter for enumerating and attacking other user account using common username wordlist We see that we found one valid existing user called “chef”, which seems interesting (as it might have some elevated privileges. Level 3 - Privilege Escalation (via \u0026ldquo;BOPLA\u0026rdquo;/Broken Object Property Level Authorization) The API endpoint PATCH /profile allows user to update their profile info.\nAs per API doc — The request does not contain “role” value.

So, let\u0026rsquo;s test this object by inserting an external URL.\nI injected a custom created URL from webhook.site, let\u0026rsquo;s see what happens!?\nUpon sending the request, we get a base64 encoded response. After base64 decoding, we get our content that we created. This means the api is fetching the content from the URL and displays it in base64 encoded format.
