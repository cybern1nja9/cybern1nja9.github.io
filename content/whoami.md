      Hi, my name is <strong>ABHISHEK (aka cybern1nja9)🥷🏻</strong> — a cybersecurity consultant, curious hacker, and a goal chaser.
    </p>
    <p>
      From my childhood I’ve always been curious about how things work and how they can be manipulated. Over time, this curiosity has driven me to dive deep into hacking and securing not only applications and networks but also physical systems and critical infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this blog, I share my experiences and thoughts on the cybersecurity, from vulnerabilities and hacking techniques to practical tips on defense. I hope you find something useful here, and I’d love to connect and chat about all things cybersecurity.
